Atlas School Project on HTML and CSS. So what is HTML and CSS? Hum, let's see how to make it plain. Hyper Text Markup Language, it's slang name, HTML- gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as, for exmple, headings, paragraphs, or images, it's so soulful.  While Cascading Style Sheets, better know as CSS, is a presentation language created to give it style, the appearance of content- using, fonts or color, in other words, it dresses it up.
the two languages- HTML and CSS- are independent of one another and should remain that way. Don't ever, never, never , never, write CSS inside of an HTML document and vice versa. Remember that HTML will always and only represent content, and CSS will always and only represent the appearance of that content.

So why does these two languages exist?
Because people were tired of opening books!  Not really, but it does have something to do with books, the time it took to check out books, having to read through the entire book before you found the points that you needed or track down the exact piece of information you were after.  Today we can jump over to a search engine, and search away because someone took the time to build a website with your exact search in mind. (I still think people were tire of reading books).

Who is HTML and CSS for?
You! Anyone that searches the web, you are that YOU. Ever wonder how it is that you type a name, title, address and wala, you have entered another world of imagination, training, documents, the skys the limit these days with what you can find on the web.  Some of it can be scary if you wonder to the wrong ones, I'm not even age appropriate to look at some of the things out there and I'm seasoned!

Let's poke fun with Atlas School website.  What is Atlas, is it still Holberton School? Is Betty still involved?  Either way, Atlas or Holberton showcases tutorials on how to become a world class software developer, machine learner, linux expert and so forth.
They are teaching us the guidelines now on how to use HTML and CSS in a semantic structure based on Figma design.  So I said, "what the heck is a Figma"?
Well I still don't know what Figma is, other than the name of a website that offers creative classes, templates to enhance your ideas from illustrated design, craft, 3D, animation and a host of other things that requires reading on a website that uses HTML and CSS to help us see color, diffent font sizes, gives us links to other websites to enhance our skills, like I said, the sky is the limit.

HTML Head Tag
A simple HTML document, with a <title> tag inside the head section.  The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.

Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
The following elements can go inside the <head> element:

<title> (required in every HTML document)
<style>
<base>
<link>
<meta>
<script>
<noscript>
All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.

The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.

Favicon:
The optimal size for favicons is 16x16 pixels. That’s how they appear in browser tabs, address bars, and bookmark lists. Ideally, you’ll create your favicon in multiple sizes. That way you’ll see properly scaled versions on larger screens rather than the 16x16 version stretched out.
Below are some of the most common sizes for favicons and their unique purposes.

16x16: The size of browser favicons.
32x32: The size of taskbar shortcut icons.
96x96: The size of desktop shortcut icons.
180x180: The size of Apple touch icons.
300x300: The size required by Squarespace.
512x512:The size required by WordPress

Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
One of those users is a search engine, which helps people discover your content. SEO—short for search engine optimization—is about helping search engines understand your content, and helping users find your site and make a decision about whether they should visit your site through a search engine.
